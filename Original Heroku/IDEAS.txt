So here is the idea.

Instead of using the "User ID" in the params we use the token because they can just change their user token to something else resulting in a "Succsessful status code" or worse change it
to somebody elses ID which can be obtained easily and spend their own GigdiBucks. but yeah have the token get sent to the server and have the server get the user ID from the token
also instead of giving the "current" amount param you can get that by making a request to find what that is and subtracting the amount due in the next slot. So basically before it makes 
the purchase its going to request the read only params on that account and grab gigdibucks value and subtract it from the amount due and sent the new result over. also finally instead of 
the amount due thingy change that so that the server goes through a list in a new file and according the the "item" param it will find the price for that and yeah so the full idea is
you give a token (login) and an item and it will use ur token to get ur user ID and using the user ID it will grab your amount of currency and it will find the price of the item you want
subtract the current amount with the price and set the ready only attribute to the new value. Also add more error messages and things like that.

Thats really all I got for you goodluck make a gigdibucks picture delete the Economy discord server and goodbye.

yeah so xsolla is dumb and decided to 
[
  {
    "key": "GigdiBucks",
    "permission": "private",
    "value": "1029234"
  }
]
where there are two lines leading to the values therefor not allowing you to phrase hopefully you can fix or something

--fixed lmao
