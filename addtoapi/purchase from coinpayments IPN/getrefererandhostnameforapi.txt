When someone buys the currency it needs to verify the request is coming from the directed hostname being for example https://sgtgigdilauncher-payprocessor.herokuapp.com because if its not then anybody
on any IP can just send a request and it will go through
CODE:
var host = req.headers.host;
var origin = req.headers.origin;
var origin2 = req.headers.referer;
console.log(ip);
console.log(host);
console.log(origin);
